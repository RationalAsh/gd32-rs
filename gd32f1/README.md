# gd32f1
This crate provides an autogenerated API for access to GD32F1 peripherals.
The API is generated using [svd2rust] with patched svd files containing
extensive type-safe support. For more information please see the [main repo].

Refer to the [documentation] for full details.

## Usage
Each device supported by this crate is behind a feature gate so that you only
compile the device(s) you want. To use, in your Cargo.toml:

```toml
[dependencies.gd32f1]
version = "0.13.0"
features = ["gd32f1x0", "rt"]
```

The `rt` feature is optional and brings in support for `cortex-m-rt`.

In your code:

```rust
use gd32f1::gd32f1x0;

let mut peripherals = gd32f1x0::Peripherals::take().unwrap();
let gpioa = &peripherals.GPIOA;
gpioa.odr.modify(|_, w| w.odr0().set_bit());
```
